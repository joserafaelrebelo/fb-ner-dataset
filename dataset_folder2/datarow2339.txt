Artists perform a dance drama titled "The Journey of a Legendary Landscape Painting," featuring elegant, ancient Chinese-style costumes and extraordinary dancing skills. The choreography is inspired by ancient Chinese painter Wang Ximeng's artwork "A Panorama of Rivers and Mountains"  which is over 11 meters (36 feet) long and is the prodigy's only surviving work. Wang was a renowned court painter during the Northern Song Dynasty more than 900 years ago. #TheVibe #CulturalInsider
