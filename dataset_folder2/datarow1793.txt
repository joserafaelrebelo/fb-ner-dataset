TAPR Is Here. Your Every-Day Carry Respirator For The Unanticipated ➡️ mirasafety.com/products/tapr-tactical-air-purifying-respirator-mask  The Tactical Air-Purifying Respirator (TAPR, for short) was originally designed for active-duty special operations.  Facing a wide range of threats and tactical challenges, these top-tier operators needed something more compact than a full-face gas mask, and more flexible than an off-the-shelf half mask.  They demanded an ultra-light, ultra-portable respirator flexible enough to fit with their helmets and gear, fast enough to deploy in seconds, and robust enough to see them through the toughest situations.  The result is one of the lightest, most compact, and flexible tactical respirators ever released.  ✅
