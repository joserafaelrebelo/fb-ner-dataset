🤩Entry confirmation: a useful lifehack  The situation of the resistance level’s breakout isn’t rare. The price breaks through the upper trendline, and then can retest it. So, the trendline, which used to be a resistance, becomes a support. As we observe the moment of the price’s return to the previously broken line, that’s the perfect moment to open a buy trade. However, just coming back is not enough: it’s necessary to see a bullish reversal candlestick pattern.  Only when we make sure that either Tweezer Bottoms, Morning Star or Three Soldiers patterns are noticeable, we open the trade. Such patterns can help you to validate your entry! Do you know other patterns that will mean bullish reversal in this case?  ➡️ https://bit.ly/3vPXdzC
