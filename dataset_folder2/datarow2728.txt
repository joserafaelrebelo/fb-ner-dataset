🐎 vs. 🐘... what does this election mean for entrepreneurs? In Episode 377 of the Wantrepreneur to Entrepreneur Podcast I reveal my true feelings about how politics change things for us as entrepreneurs.  ⚠️ SPOILER ALERT: No matter what happens, no candidate is going to save us... ultimately it's on US to keep taking care of the three things we can: taking care of ourselves, taking care of the people we care about, and doing good work to serve our customers and clients.  🚀 What are you committed to keep working on in your business? I'd love to hear from you in the comments!
