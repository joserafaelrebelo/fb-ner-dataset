Late March to late November is the windy season at KiteParadise Madagascar. 🏖👌🏻  Searching for an AMAZING place to kitesurf, windsurf, swim, or even just relax and practice yoga? 🏖👌🏻 🧘🏽‍♀️🧘🏼‍♂️ Look no more! KiteParadise is THE place to be! 🌴 The water is unbelievably clear and flat and the sand is powdery white. Also, we just finished renovating/ redecorating the hotel. 🙏 🤗 We have more cozy chill-out areas and a nice lounge area near our outstanding baobab rooms. And that's not all - We also offer delicious and fresh food from our restaurant and pizzeria. 🥑🥥🍍What more can you ask for?   https://www.kiteparadise-madagascar.com/ #kitesurf #kitesurfing #
