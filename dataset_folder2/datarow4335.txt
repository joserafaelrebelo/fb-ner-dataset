The Israeli Defence Forces, commonly referred to by its acronym IDF, are the combined military forces of the State of Israel, consisting of three branches: the Israeli Ground Forces, the Israeli Air Force and the Israeli Navy.   Ever since the creation of the State of Israel in 1948, the IDF has constantly been engaged in various forms of military operations.   A formidable military machine to some, an occupation force to others, the IDF is one of the most discussed and controversial armed forces in the world. It's also one of the most experienced and successful ones in modern history, with victories in several major wars against opponents who often outnumbered the IDF, that gave it an almost mythical status.   This post is the first part of a series that takes a closer look at the IDF and what makes the armed forces of this small country such a successful one.
