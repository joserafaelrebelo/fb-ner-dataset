In early summer, the breeze is light and the sky is blue at Mutianyu Great Wall. Climbing up to the Zheng GuanTai Pass, you can look back and see the picturesque landscape. This ancient construction project, which spans thousands of years and stretches over ten thousand miles, has seen countless beacons and wolves, as well as gold and iron horses. Today, it still stands guard over the mountains, accompanied by the sun, moon and stars. The wind sounds as if it were telling a story of the past or as if it were an ancient chant. #mutianyu #GreatWall #chinatrip #traveldaily #instagreatwall #nationalpark #travel #mutianyu #traveladdict #lifewelltravel #traveldreamseekers #慕田峪 #lifetime
