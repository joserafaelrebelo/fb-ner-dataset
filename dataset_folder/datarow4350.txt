Adding the Xunantunich Mayan Ruins to our Belize trip has been a hit (which may or may not be influenced by the resident pup...comment 🐶 when you see it!). ⁠ ⁠ We're excited to continue bringing travelers to this site and exploring the town of San Ignacio a bit before heading out to enjoy the island life. ⁠ ⁠ There are still seats available this fall if you want to come join us!⁠ ⁠ 📸: reynier_cascante_
