Descricão
A first glimpse of the forthcoming Maison Rose, the soon to be centerpiece of our Domaine de la Rose in the south of France, which materializes our concrete commitments in a spirit of energy conservation and ecological renovation, seeking to reduce the environmental impact of its entire life cycle. The public will be able to discover the perfumery savoir-faire of the House starting in 2023. We can’t wait to share more from our new home soon.
