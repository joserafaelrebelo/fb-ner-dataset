Agartha - The Earth's Inner World  Mariana Stjerna made contact with Timothy Brooke, a Canadian, who appeared to her briefly and then "dictated" this book. He was saved by Agarthans from a shipwreck off the coast of Canada mid-20th century, and is now alive and well in Agartha. In this lovely Novel, he recounts his story and describes life in this five-dimensional paradise.  https://www.soullink.se/books_from_us/steg1/?ID=25
