"just like before" this is the first song that I had written in both korean and english. I moved to the US when I was young, so I don't speak Korean very well at all; so after I wrote the first draft of this, I sent it to my mom for review and she said "this makes no sense" haha I still kinda don't know if it makes a whole lot of sense, but i hope it sounds ok to your ear holes.  click "listen now" to hear the rest, or link in bio  find me on spotify / ig full video on youtube
