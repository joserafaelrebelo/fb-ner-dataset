A dream has finally come true: BRAVA for Kids is here! 😍We have been waiting for this moment for some time, and we're so happy to present it to you now! 💙 10 different designs from the leftover fabrics of our most beloved adult pieces that we have upcycled, and given a new life. These are cut from pure organic cotton to a comfy unisex fit. It is a collection made for explorative children, for ear-to-ear smiles, for the next generation.✨To use our resources even more sustainably, these pieces can now be pre-ordered and will only be produced on demand. More upcycling. Less waste.Special thanks to Esther and all the girls from @estherboschescuela for the amazing choreography, dancing and the good vibes at the set ❤️
