Welcome to week 4 of our series "The Prophet"! What is a prophet? A prophet is a messenger from God and there were many in the Old Testament. They were sent to inspire action or change…to lead when chaos ruled the day. Over the next four weeks, we’re going to examine the life of one particular prophet who is regarded by Jews and Christians alike as one of the most powerful prophets in history, a true spiritual giant. The prophet Elijah.
