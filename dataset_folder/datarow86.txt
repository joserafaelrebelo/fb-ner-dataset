Guitar & Sax 🎸🎷 // #TBT. A little over a year ago I transcribed David Sanborn feat in the song Asa by Djavan, making a unison with the guitar. I've always liked wind instruments, especially sax, but it was when I recorded this video, while I was recording the guitars for my songs, I had a insight how to incorporate these elements into the EP! I hope you guys like this video memory! Thank you! ❤✨
