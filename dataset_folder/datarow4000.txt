Hello, to my Facebook friends. It's been a while but I've been busy working on my novels. I'll be sharing some information soon that's pertinent to my novels concerning Marvel Studios who doesn't like me using the name Afro Avengers. They're trying to stop me from using it because they say it confusing from their customs. I'd like to hear what all my brother and sister's think about that. Myself, I think they are stealing my idea so they can make money off of black people. They've been in business 83 years and have never even considered us the word AFRO. And those years they've only produced 3 black superheroes and dozens of white ones. That's their market and I trying to brand mine. Tell me what you think and if you would please share this post so the world can see an example of SYSTEMIC RACISM. I NEED
