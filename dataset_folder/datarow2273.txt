Isabelle Noah is a beautiful girl, who just lost her father in a car accident. Her mother had died when she was just 10. Now she's 19 and has to look after her younger siblings. Nobody was hiring her on a job due to no experience. Somehow she became a janitor in one of the top academies and the pay was enough to keep her family alive. Blade Tyson, a 24 years old is one of the worst boys in that academy. He was ridiculously handsome, but unfortunately was the biggest bully with a charming smile. The situation got worse for Isabelle when Blade got to know the janitor who wore a fake beard is actually a beautiful girl working as a male janitor. ---------------------------------------------- âž¡ Read the full text of the book for free in this link: https://cutt.ly/hHexwiU ðŸ“– ---------------------------------------------- Register on the site
