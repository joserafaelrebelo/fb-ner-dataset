I Ching:

Descricão
It took me almost two years to finish this reading. Two years-ish while I read dozens of books. Perhaps, subconsciously I postponed to keep it longer close to me. Of all books I've read, this one caught me in blended sentiments as if I was a part of it: the characters were distressing and relatable; they made me a dualist. And in resemblance made me fall from the horse.  I despised utterly Scarlett several times- as much as I loved her. I loathed Rhett too often to count - as much as I cared for him. I pitied Mellanie constantly, although, in the end, the tables have turned. Concerning Ashley, no expectations were invested whatsoever. I remain apathetic towards him (bloody tedious). In short, relatable characters and a breath-taking narrative.  Despite the negative bringing: r@cist perspectives are blatantly shown both in the book and in the movie- the author cooks perfectly a hot plate of well-seasoned souper, warming up the reader, delivering taste, scent and fulfilment.
