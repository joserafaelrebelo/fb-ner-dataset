💚 I loooove this clip of Deepak Chopra. Yes, the way we look is 100% connected to how we feel. As we move away from the plain 3D world, this is becoming more and more obvious to the masses. Outer beauty is the product of our inner thoughts and feelings. This is especially true in our days and age where karma works pretty much instantly and those ugly thoughts will be picked up, as unpinnable ‘vibes’ by our surroundings.  🦚 Tbh, beauty is my strongest area of interest — I’m a Libra after all! 😅 — but there is so much more to it than just looking good. You will find beauty in others when your own ideals are being reflected. So if your ideals are questionable, you might find narcissists attractive…   💎 Beauty is mental work. Believe it or not, Earth signs actually rule our nervous system. It starts from the inside, there is karma to clear. It’s about you attaining total bliss and contentment, being compassionate and kind. That’s the jaw dropping wow factor.   🦋 Beauty is also a strong indicator of health: radiant skin, shiny hair, strong nails, sparkly eyes,… The way you look gives a naturopath great insight on your vitality, and is once again so dependent on what thoughts you have. It’s all connected.   💐 Taurus teaches us that, to emanate true beauty, one must first work on its values. The most important one being to love oneself. Notice how the confident ones always look so radiant. The shadow side of Venus is shallow, superficial, and self-absorbed. This occurs when Venus has not been anchored in Taurus energy, therefore lacking its ultimate substance.    🧚🏻 So today make sure you raise your personal standards and think some good thoughts so that your outer reality can match that beauty 💚  #beauty #aesthetic  #taurus #taurusseason #venus #venusenergy #taurusgang
