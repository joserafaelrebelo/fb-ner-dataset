We couldn’t be prouder of our Ambassador Edmilson Angelo, Founder of @change1slife which operates across Sub-Saharan Africa, transforming rural communities.   “The future of the upcoming generation is being put at risk because underprivileged communities are not being given the opportunity and resources… to invest in their own future. For the past seven years at Change 1s Life we have been building digital and ecological villages what I call our green villages and smart villages to help communities come alive.” - @e.n.f.angelo  Double tap if you’re as inspired as we are 💙 🌍  Find out more about Edmilson, and Ambassadors like him, in our Impact Report 2021 – link in bio.  #OneYoungWorld #OYW #OYWAmbassador #ImpactReport #Sustainability #OYW2022 #BeTheChange #community #motivation  #inspirational
