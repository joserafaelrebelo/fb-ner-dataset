"Onigiri" Rice Balls 🍙 Also called "omusubi", these rice balls offer an interesting variety of fillings and ingredients. Fillings can be Japanese-style, such as pickled Japanese apricot or grilled salmon; or they may be western-influenced, like tuna mixed with mayonnaise. In Japan you'll find onigiri at specialty shops, department stores, train stations and "konbini" (convenience stores)!  ➡️ Stay tuned for an onigiri recipe in our next post! 😊  To learn more about onigiri & other Japanese food culture, check the link in our profile (@kikkoman_global)!🧡  "food forum" is Kikkoman's quarterly newsletter.
