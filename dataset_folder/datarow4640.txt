It’s a Jazzy day! 😄 The NEW one hour lesson “15 JAZZ LINES Vol. 3” is out right now! 🍾 In this lesson, we focus on one of the most common chord progressions in Jazz music; the minor II V I. Digging deep into the examples to learn more about arpeggios, scales, phrasing, outlining changes, chromatics, using motifs and technique! ☺️ You get accurate tabs for all the examples plus great sounding backing tracks for your practice session!
