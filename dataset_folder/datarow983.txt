😡 I can’t stand lazy dropshippers.  It seems half of the people dropshipping these days expect immediate results with little to no effort. That may have worked 5 years ago, but listen up guys, in 2021 you need to work HARDER and be SMARTER than your competition.  For example, did you know when you sort products on AliExpress by “order count”, it’s including all orders from the last 6 months?  This means the products with the most orders are almost always the most oversold and saturated by other dropshippers... yet, everyone keeps trying to sell them anyways. 😰  What you really want to look for are products that have been growing fast in the past week, relative to other products in the same category...  📈 This is known as a product's relative growth rate.  This will help you
