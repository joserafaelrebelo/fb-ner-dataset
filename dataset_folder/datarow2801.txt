My flexibility journey: March 2020 VS March 2022🕺🏻. There were days that I just wanted to give up but I got addicted in seeing progress on and off the pole. I received a lot of dms of people asking me if they can still start stretching/pole dancing because they are “too old”. All I can say is, if you can still get off your bed, it’s never too late.  I started pole dancing when I was 21 (with no gymnastics background) people who know me, know that I was STIFF! It would be difficult but not impossible, stay determined and you would see progress 🤗. #flexibility #flexibilitytraining #backbend #scorpionpose #yogaflexibility #journeytosplits
