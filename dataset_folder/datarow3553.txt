Break Bread or Play Dead: The Iris Dawson Story  Written by Niki Jilvontae  Synopsis  A hard head makes a soft a**” is a saying many of us have heard before. Usually it’s something said when you’re being grown and not doing what you KNOW you’re supposed to do. This saying is especially true in the case of Iris Dawson. Once a good student from a middle class, two parent home, Iris was destined for greatness. Until she got a taste for fast money and celebrity status. Even if it was just hood fame, Iris wanted it along with power and respect. So she takes on her aunt Tootie’s persona and starts finessing men. Her Break Bread or Play Dead motto helps her to achieve top notch hood credibility and a nice little bank roll to match. All of it comes at a cost and Iris finds that out when her world turns upside down. Her actions lead her down a path of lies, betrayal, violence, and murder which eventually turns into jail time! After she’s given 23 years at 18, Iris has to reflect on her life and tell the story of the hood menace known as The Infamous ICE!
