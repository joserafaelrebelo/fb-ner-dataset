“She thought of her mother, but not as lightly as before and thus new worlds dawned behind the black veil of grief. Like a look at the sea from the dark fortress of the coast, so the possibilities of life are revealed by the child’s first sorrow.”  - Andreas Munch . . . #drawing #sketch #artwork #colouredpencil #painting #pencildrawing #art #artist #draw #artofinstagram #psychedelicart #psychedelic #artistsoninstagram #cartoon #cartoonart #popart #looneytunes #mariokart #bugsbunny #pokemon #philosophy #fawkes #wkes #perthart #perthartist #australianartist
